# Task-7-VPN-setup-steps-and-connection-status
To Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

## Objective

The objective of this task is to understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and enabling secure communication over the internet. By using a free VPN service, we verified how VPNs mask the real IP address, encrypt traffic, and protect user identity online.

## Tools Used

- ProtonVPN (Free Tier)

- WhatIsMyIPAddress.com (for IP verification)

## Procedure

- Baseline Check (Before VPN Connection):

- Visited WhatIsMyIPAddress.com
.
- Original IP was detected as belonging to India (ISP: Reliance Jio).

- Screenshot saved: Encrypted_original_ipaddress.png.

## VPN Setup:

Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account.

Installed the ProtonVPN desktop client.

Logged in and connected to the Fastest Free Server (Netherlands).

- Screenshot saved: Vpn_connect_ipaddrs.png.

- Verify VPN Connection:

- Checked IP again on WhatIsMyIPAddress.com.

- New IP appeared from the Netherlands (ISP: WorldStream B.V.).

- Screenshot saved: Vpn_connect_ipaddrs.png.

## Traffic Encryption Test:

- Browsed websites while connected to VPN.

- Verified that traffic passed through the VPN tunnel and original IP was hidden.

## Disconnect VPN & Recheck:

- Disconnected ProtonVPN.

- Checked IP again — original IP from India was restored.

- Screenshot saved: After_disconnect_Ipaddrs.png.

## Observations ##

Without VPN: My real IP and location (India) were visible.

With VPN: IP and location were masked (Netherlands).

After Disconnecting VPN: My original IP reappeared.

## VPN Benefits ##

- Hides real IP address and location.
- Encrypts internet traffic, securing data from hackers and ISPs.
- Provides access to region-restricted content.
- Protects against online tracking.

## VPN Limitations ##

- Free VPN servers may have slower speeds due to high load.
- Limited server options in free versions.
- VPNs do not make users “fully anonymous” — ISPs and VPN providers may still have logs.
- Some websites block known VPN IP addresses.

Conclusion

This exercise demonstrated how a VPN works in practice. By connecting to ProtonVPN, my real IP address was successfully masked, and encrypted communication was established. VPNs are an important privacy tool, but they should be used alongside other security practices like strong passwords, HTTPS browsing, and avoiding suspicious extensions.
